        |It provides a grid interface to search for items in different leagues.<br>
        |The XP view will attempt to predict when a gem will level up.<br>
        |GGG seems to only refresh items and gem information when a character changes zones,

        |<h4> Tips & Tricks & Miscellaneous Details </h4>
        |<ul>
        |<li>You can type things to search for into the empty row at the top of the grids.
        |<ul>
        |<li>Try starting the search with &gt; or &lt; or =</li>
        |<li>The search is not case sensitive.</li>
        |<li>If the first term isn't an operator, then it defaults to regular expression search.</li>
        |<li>| between words are treated as an 'OR', use this to search for several different types at once, for example: gloves|helmet|boots</li>
        |</ul>
        |</li>
        |<li>You can type into multiple columns to filter down to what you want, for example to find boots with a red
        |socket that can be worn by characters under level 35, enter <i>boots</i> in the <b>type</b> column
        |and <i>r</i> in the <b>sockets</b> column and <i>&lt;35</i> in the <b>rlvl</b> column.
        |</li>
        |<li>Click the column titles to sort by them, shift clicking allows multi-sorting</li>
        |<li>Click on a character / stash tab button to update that stash tab from the server, and to show only it's contents.</li>
        |<li>Use the clear and reload everything button when you need to update several stash tabs, or you re-ordered them</li>
        |<li>Sockets in the socket column are displayed first by largest group, then in alphabetical order. That means G-G-R-R won't ever be listed as G-R-G-R or other permutations.</li>
        |<li>Entering .-.-.-. in the sockets column will match all four link+ socketed items</li>
        |<li>Entering B-B-G-R in the sockets column will match all four link+ socketed items, that have 2 blues linked with a green and red. </li>
        |<li>The UI is dark so that you can leave it up on a second monitor while you play.</li>
        |<li>The score field was roughly based on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1q5rdi/its_worth_keeping_if/">this</a> reddit post</li>
        |<li>Looty was written in <a href="http://www.scala-js.org/">ScalaJs</a></li>
