# Version History
## 0.2.1.83 (2021-10-27)
Features
  - added Scourge items
    - new column scourged - to quickly check which items are scourged (works same as corrupted etc.)

  - added new base armor types from 3.15

  It should be only entry in filter box

## 0.2.1.81 (2021-04-25) (Traf contributed this update)

Features
- Added input field to filter mod buttons (above mod list on the left) to help you choose desired ones faster.
(this feature uses something called fuzzy search, it searches all letter occurrences, so if you type "life" it would select also "the type line of an item", it is as good as it gets :) )

  - #% Increased Intellect
  - #% Increased Strength
  - #% increased Damage
  - #% increased Area Damage
  - #% increased Melee Damage

All suggestions welcomed!

Added columns for cluster jewels affixes:
   - Adds # Passive Skills
   - # Added Passives is/are Jewel Socket - number of sockets
   - # Added Small Passive (also) grants # - what stats you gain with small passives
   - # Added Passive Skill is # - what skill(s) cluster jewel adds

  - #% to Cold Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Fire Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Chaos Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Non-Ailment Chaos Damage over Time Multiplier

Gave some love to minion, totem, traps and mines builds:

  - Minions have #% increased Attack Speed
  - Minions have #% increased Cast Speed
  - Minions have #% increased maximum Life

  - #% increased Trap Throwing Speed
  - #% increased Totem Damage
  - #% increased Totem Life
  - Totems gain +#% to all Elemental Resistances

Changes to gem mods:
  - renamed previous mod group "Gems"  to "Socketed Gems Level"
  - added column for mod "Socketed Gems are Supported by Level x #" - in this column you will get name of that spell
  - added mod groups for "Spell Gems Level" and "Gems Level" so it shows now:
    - # to Level of all # Skill Gem
    - # to Level of all # Spell Skill Gem

Fixes
  - heist items for hirelings, contracts and blueprints are correctly recognized
  - resonators are recognized as separate type
  - crafted mod, showing if item has crafted mod is fixed

## 0.2.1.79 (2021-01-15)
Special thanks, again, to Traf27 for keeping Looty going!

Design
- Added dark theme! to easy strain on your eyes at night - switch is on the right side
- item tooltips in dark theme now closer resemble those on official site/in game
- added Incubators to item tooltips - fancy progressbar with current/total kills and what it's incubating into
- added improvements to XP page and its gem experience tables

Features
- Added option to Settings panel to show tooltip when CTRL key is pressed, solving issue with tooltip obscuring vision.
  note: When pressing ctrl being on some row, you have to reenter this row with mouse pointer to show tooltip - thats best I can do right now
- Added option to Settings panel to align text in tooltip to the left - in dark theme is centered - so you can override it here.

- Added following columns
	- IncubatorReward - what incubator on item is going to drop
	- % Armor local to item
	- % Evasion Rating local to item
	- % Energy Shield local to item
	- % Armor global to character stats - now recognize "% increased Armor" on talismans, rings, belts, jewels
	- % Evasion Rating global to character stats - now recognize "% increased Evasion Rating" on talismans, rings, belts, jewels
	- % chance to Dodge Spell Hits
	- % chance to Block Spells Damage
	- Added columns for checking if items are: Identified, Crafted, Corrupted, Veiled, Synthesised (has fractured modes), Mirrored to new group Miscellaneous, moved also influences there which shows list of influences on item
	note: Enchanted items has own columns enchc (enchants count) and ench (enchants list)

- Bug fixes
	- flasks display now their real values instead of "{0}" and "{1}"
	- enchants are not duplicated anymore in column "unparsed"
	- changed behavior of Evasion Rating and Armor increased mods, added their local variations, and added local Energy Shield increase
	- armor and evasion rating are correctly calculated and now are global - it recognize "% increased Armor" and "% increased Evasion Rating" on talismans, rings, belts, jewels
	- items with dexterity include "global Evasion Rating" column (as every 5 dexterity increases Evasion Rating by 1 %)

## 0.2.1.78 (2020-09-17)
- Added types
	- "Organs" (from Metamorph league)
	- Timeless Jewel
- Added columns for affixes like :
	- "Regenerate (amount) Life/Mana per Second"
	- "Regenerate (amount)% of Life/Mana per Second"
	- "Grants LeveL (skillLevel) (skillName) Skill" - skillLevel
	- "Grants LeveL (skillLevel) (skillName) Skill" - skillName
	- added +% maximum life affix
	- influences (elder, shaper, crusader, redeemer, hunter, warlord)
	- enchantments for gloves, boots, helmets from Labirynth,
	  rings and amulets (from Cassia - Blight league), cluster jewels (Delirium)
- Added properties (mostly used by jewels)
	- "Limited to"
	- "Radius"
- You can now see names and quantity for enchantments
	- for gloves, boots, helmets from Labirynth
	- rings and amulets (from Cassia - Blight league)
	- cluster jewels, "Adds x Passive Skills", "Added Small Passive Skills grant: xxx" (Delirium)
- Added column mod "unparsed"
	It gathers mods without its own proper column, it looks like "a| b| c| ..."
	You can search them via matching text.
	For example: when want to find all "zombie" items you have,
	type "zombies" into "unparsed" column field and it should show all items, with word "zombie"
	in affixes. I don't have any other solution for now. :)

- UI background readability improvements on Home, Xp, Wealth, Maps, Settings pages
  - table columns can be resized again
  - switched off Maps and Poebuilder subpages
	- adjusted mod button position
  - increased font size from 14px to 16px
	- changed color of disabled column to light grey

        |<h4> Tips & Tricks & Miscellaneous Details </h4>
        |<ul>
        |<li>You can type things to search for into the empty row at the top of the grids.
        |<ul>
        |<li>Try starting the search with &gt; or &lt; or =</li>
        |<li>The search is not case sensitive.</li>
        |<li>If the first term isn't an operator, then it defaults to regular expression search.</li>
        |<li>| between words are treated as an 'OR', use this to search for several different types at once, for example: gloves|helmet|boots</li>
        |</ul>
        |</li>
        |<li>You can type into multiple columns to filter down to what you want, for example to find boots with a red
        |socket that can be worn by characters under level 35, enter <i>boots</i> in the <b>type</b> column
        |and <i>r</i> in the <b>sockets</b> column and <i>&lt;35</i> in the <b>rlvl</b> column.
        |</li>
        |<li>Click the column titles to sort by them, shift clicking allows multi-sorting</li>
        |<li>Click on a character / stash tab button to update that stash tab from the server, and to show only it's contents.</li>
        |<li>Use the clear and reload everything button when you need to update several stash tabs, or you re-ordered them</li>
        |<li>Sockets in the socket column are displayed first by largest group, then in alphabetical order. That means G-G-R-R won't ever be listed as G-R-G-R or other permutations.</li>
        |<li>Entering .-.-.-. in the sockets column will match all four link+ socketed items</li>
        |<li>Entering B-B-G-R in the sockets column will match all four link+ socketed items, that have 2 blues linked with a green and red. </li>
        |<li>The UI is dark so that you can leave it up on a second monitor while you play.</li>
        |<li>The score field was roughly based on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1q5rdi/its_worth_keeping_if/">this</a> reddit post</li>
