Looty
=====
A browser extension for Path of Exile that makes inventory searching fun!

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/looty/ajfbflclpnpbjkfibijekgcombcgehbi?hl=en&gl=US)

Built using [ScalaJs](http://www.scala-js.org/) based on [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

### How to build for firefox reviewers:
#### Prequisites
1. Have nvs (https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) installed for node (This version of ScalaJS needs node version 8 installed)
2. Have java8 installed (This version of Scala doesn't support later jvms)

run bin/deploy

build/build.zip will have the packaged file

## Statement of Inspiration

Quoted from Steve Yegge's [Excellent Blog Post](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-borderlands-2-gun-discarders-club.html) About Borderlands 2, which is another loot game
>Here's the thing, though. It's not just about capacity. If Gearbox wants to do this Right, by which I mean pull their heads out and do something that nobody in the game industry has ever done before, what they really need to do is give players a database.
>
>That's what we want, really. You make 87 bazillion guns, and let us collect them? Well then we're going to want hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of guns in our collections. Not twenty, or whatever stupidly low number you've given us. That just spawns modding and mule characters and leaving the game altogether -- any outlet from the collection pressure; players will use them all.
>
>What BL1 needed was a way for you to effectively manage a collection of a thousand guns. What if you want to look at all your Mashers? Or all your weapons by type, or by elemental damage, or by manufacturer? I'm not asking for a data warehouse here, or for some fancy text-based console-query UI. I mean, -I- would use it, but obviously we want to keep this mainstream.
>
>If you start by formulating the basic problem as: "How do I manage a collection of a thousand guns," then your UX guys should be able to come up with something acceptable. No â€” you know what? Fuck acceptable. They should be able to come up with something awesome, something in keeping with the innovation and forward-looking badassery that we've all come to associate with Gearbox and Borderlands.

# Version History
## 0.2.1.83 (2021-10-27)

## 0.2.1.81 (2021-04-25) (Traf contributed this update)

Features
- Added input field to filter mod buttons (above mod list on the left) to help you choose desired ones faster.
(this feature uses something called fuzzy search, it searches all letter occurrences, so if you type "life" it would select also "the type line of an item", it is as good as it gets :) )

Added columns for affixes :
  - #% Increased Attributes
  - #% Increased Dexterity
  - #% Increased Intellect
  - #% Increased Strength
  - #% increased Damage
  - #% increased Area Damage
  - #% increased Melee Damage
  - #% increased Attack Damage
  - #% increased Area of Effects
  
Turned on score column, as some of you liked it. Although its a bit outdated, i'll try to add there stats from time to time.
All suggestions welcomed!

Added columns for cluster jewels affixes:
  - Adds # Passive Skills
  - # Added Passives is/are Jewel Socket - number of sockets
  - # Added Small Passive (also) grants # - what stats you gain with small passives
  - # Added Passive Skill is # - what skill(s) cluster jewel adds

Added "Damage over Time" mod group, which supports following mods:
  - #% to Cold Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Fire Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Chaos Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Non-Ailment Chaos Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Physical Damage over Time Multiplier
  - #% to Damage over Time Multiplier for Bleeding
  - #% to Damage over Time Multiplier

Gave some love to minion, totem, traps and mines builds:

  - Minions have #% increased Attack Speed
  - Minions have #% increased Cast Speed
  - Minions have #% increased maximum Life

  - #% increased Mine Throwing Speed
  - #% increased Trap Damage
  - #% increased Trap Throwing Speed
  - #% increased Totem Damage
  - #% increased Totem Life
  - Totems gain +#% to all Elemental Resistances

Changes to gem mods:
  - renamed previous mod group "Gems"  to "Socketed Gems Level" 
  - added column for mod "Socketed Gems are Supported by Level x #" - in this column you will get name of that spell
  - added mod groups for "Spell Gems Level" and "Gems Level" so it shows now:
    - # to Level of all # Skill Gem
    - # to Level of all # Spell Skill Gem

Fixes
  - heist items for hirelings, contracts and blueprints are correctly recognized
  - resonators are recognized as separate type
  - crafted mod, showing if item has crafted mod is fixed

## 0.2.1.79 (2021-01-15)
Special thanks, again, to Traf27 for keeping Looty going!

Design
- Added dark theme! to easy strain on your eyes at night - switch is on the right side
- item tooltips in dark theme now closer resemble those on official site/in game
- added Incubators to item tooltips - fancy progressbar with current/total kills and what it's incubating into
- added improvements to XP page and its gem experience tables

Features
- Added option to Settings panel to show tooltip when CTRL key is pressed, solving issue with tooltip obscuring vision.
  note: When pressing ctrl being on some row, you have to reenter this row with mouse pointer to show tooltip - thats best I can do right now
- Added option to Settings panel to align text in tooltip to the left - in dark theme is centered - so you can override it here.

- Added following columns
	- IncubatorReward - what incubator on item is going to drop
	- % Armor local to item
	- % Evasion Rating local to item
	- % Energy Shield local to item
	- % Armor global to character stats - now recognize "% increased Armor" on talismans, rings, belts, jewels
	- % Evasion Rating global to character stats - now recognize "% increased Evasion Rating" on talismans, rings, belts, jewels
	- % chance to Dodge Spell Hits
	- % chance to Block Spells Damage
	- Added columns for checking if items are: Identified, Crafted, Corrupted, Veiled, Synthesised (has fractured modes), Mirrored to new group Miscellaneous, moved also influences there which shows list of influences on item
	note: Enchanted items has own columns enchc (enchants count) and ench (enchants list)

- Bug fixes
	- flasks display now their real values instead of "{0}" and "{1}"
	- enchants are not duplicated anymore in column "unparsed"
	- changed behavior of Evasion Rating and Armor increased mods, added their local variations, and added local Energy Shield increase
	- armor and evasion rating are correctly calculated and now are global - it recognize "% increased Armor" and "% increased Evasion Rating" on talismans, rings, belts, jewels
	- items with dexterity include "global Evasion Rating" column (as every 5 dexterity increases Evasion Rating by 1 %)
```

```code

## 0.2.1.78 (2020-09-17)
- Added types
	- "Organs" (from Metamorph league)
	- Timeless Jewel
- Added columns for affixes like :
	- "Regenerate (amount) Life/Mana per Second"
	- "Regenerate (amount)% of Life/Mana per Second"
	- "Grants LeveL (skillLevel) (skillName) Skill" - skillLevel
	- "Grants LeveL (skillLevel) (skillName) Skill" - skillName
	- added +% maximum life affix
	- influences (elder, shaper, crusader, redeemer, hunter, warlord)

	  rings and amulets (from Cassia - Blight league), cluster jewels (Delirium)

- Added column mod "unparsed"

	You can search them via matching text.
	For example: when want to find all "zombie" items you have,
	type "zombies" into "unparsed" column field and it should show all items, with word "zombie"
	in affixes. I don't have any other solution for now. :)

- UI background readability improvements on Home, Xp, Wealth, Maps, Settings pages
  - table columns can be resized again
  - switched off Maps and Poebuilder subpages

#### Public [trello board](https://trello.com/b/xr7dx96M/looty) for tracking progress on tasks I am actively working on.



## Todo
<details><summary>Authors original todo's</summary>
<p>

### Newer todos:
- Card Views
  - allows seeing gems / uniques etc as items in a 2d grid of cells
    - each cell is like a card
  - beefs up the map view
    - though replace the map view with an atlas view

### For pure love of the loot
- [ ] Collectors view for Uniques (grayed out pictures for Uniques not obtained)
- [ ] Trophy room that allows for displaying epic items. With categories (Best DPS Item, Highest Score By Slot)

### Loot Management
- [x] Odd / even row colors (fph)
- [x] Allow users to save filter sets
- [x] Load StashTab on click
- [x] Add / Remove Columns (prioritized for fph)
- [x] Require ctrl to show tooltips (fph suggestion)
- [ ] Custom and better default item scoring options [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1q5rdi/its_worth_keeping_if/)
- [ ] Show reason for score in the item detail.
- [ ] Ability to click on a row and label the item in that row
- [ ] Column for recipes for an item (chromatics mostly)
- [ ] Recipes view
- [ ] Custom Calculated Columns
- [ ] Multi-Select Rows with Ctrl (useful for other features)
- [ ] Label items with colors (how can this persist across item moves?)
- [ ] Create an inventory view that shows item by color for help organizing / garbage collecting items
- [ ] Recipes (Chaos for set etc, not sure if GGG frowns on this or not)
- [ ] Give the players a playing mode (via the leveling screen) and let them mark certain stash tabs as auto-refresh then auto-watch those tabs and make sounds when an item is looted and identified that passes certain filters.
- [ ] Custom Filter sets (can be tied to store pages)
- [ ] Decode an item's affixes and show how it matches up to best ones available in the item detail display
- [ ] Show how good an item is compared to the best in slot for the level compared to other items the player has

### Extensibility and compatability with other sites
- [ ] Act as a secure API that can get data up to other sites and act as a Pseudo API until GGG makes one (if they do, *cough* item level *ahem* item uuids *ATAZIRIQUADSWTFCHOO* last mod time get-stash-items/{tabs:1} *hack*)
- [x] Provide CSV / Google Document export of items table
- [ ] Upload builds / equipment to the http://poebuilds.com
- [ ] Get stats for current character's build from http://poebuilds.com and use it to calculate actual dps and so on for a character with an item and for a skill

### Trading help
- [ ] Templating to automatically create shop posts, via custom filters.
- [ ] Search for similar items on http://poe.xy.is [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1vodwm/faster_trading_with_poexyz/ceu9n5m)
- [ ] User online tracking that can be sent to third party sites, to indicate that the user is able to trade
- [ ] Integrate with instant messaging platforms / chat rooms and provide those hooks up to trading sites (web-rtc?) to allow users to trade with each other

### Improved Program Logic
- [ ] Smart detection of moved items
- [ ] User can mark an item as moved and inventory as dirty
- [ ] Handle when stash tabs are re-ordered
- [ ] Allow users to upload items whose affixes failed to parse
- [ ] Or maybe make affix parsers configurable
- [ ] Better refresh logic, remove only stash tabs might be left behind after a refresh

### User Help
- [x] Messaging Area To Help players understand what is going on as it loads
- [ ] Turn guide in this format, progress meter at top is neat [gitbookio](http://web.archive.org/web/20140404205153/http://gitbookio.github.io/javascript/README.html)
- [ ] Simplify Demo Home Page to be a lot more like http://haste-lang.org/
- [ ] Tutorial video on searches operators within the boxes
- [ ] Add feedback / suggestion options inside of the extension itself

https://github.com/benjaminjackman/looty/blob/master/looty/src/main/scala/looty/LootyMain.scala#L40  

With class PoeCacherDemo you have ability to load data from .json file when you place it in build directory /data/ 
To check it out just switch it in place of    
```
 implicit val pc: PoeCacher = {
    if (extensionMode) {
      // load data from /data/sample-items.json instead of GGG servers
      //new PoeCacherJSON()
      // fetch data from GGG API
      new PoeCacherChrome()
    } else {
      new PoeCacherExileTools()
    }
  }
```  
Now you are free to use whatever item data you wish, and test it to your heart content without worrying for download API limits.

If you would like to prepare your own sample-item.json file. Here's [how-to](./HowTo-sample-items-file.md).

### How to build for iterative development
#### Prequisites

1. Have nvs (https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) installed for node (This version of ScalaJS needs node version 8 installed)
2. Have java8 installed (https://github.com/frekele/oracle-java/releases) (This version of Scala doesn't support later jvms)
3. Have SBT (Simple Build Tool) for compiling Scala into js. This is already __included__ in looty project (sbt-launch-0.13.0.jar).
And is run via sbt or sbt-win.cmd commands.

in the project root at command line:  
#### Linux:

    bin/sbt
#### Windows:

	bin\sbt-win.cmd
    
Build a development version with:  

    fastOptJS
    
To generate .js on the fly, while you save any changes in code use:

	~fastOptJS


A javascript fill will be built at:  

    looty/target/web/public/main/looty-fastopt.js

This folder has the manifest and can be used with firefox for debugging:  

    looty/target/web/public/main/

Load it in firefox with `about:debugging` use looty-dev.html

### How to build for firefox reviewers and release:

Note: Firefox Add-on's come in form of .ixr files. Which are simply zip files with different extension. 

Bump version number in:
    
    ./looty/src/main/public/manifest.json
    ./looty/src/main/scala/looty/views/HomeView.scala
    
 ### Linux:
 
    bin/deploy

`/build/build.zip` will have the packaged file  
`/build/buildffsrc.zip` will have firefox release package file

#### Windows:

    bin\sbt-win.cmd
    
in sbt, optional 

    clean
and    
    
    compile
    fullOptJS    

Because windows does not come with default zip command line tool, which could automate this part, we have to zip files ourselves. :crying_cat_face:  
Zip following files and directories into choose-some-name.zip 
(for installation in ff change extension to irx)
    
    jslib/
    images/
    less/
    looty.html
    popup.html
    looty-opt.js
    manifest.json
    
Additionaly for release version:    
    
    looty/
    project/
    bin/
    README.md
