Looty
=====
A browser extension for Path of Exile that makes inventory searching fun!


Available on the [Firefox Marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/looty-path-of-exile-stash-find/) and
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/looty/ajfbflclpnpbjkfibijekgcombcgehbi?hl=en&gl=US)

Built using [ScalaJs](http://www.scala-js.org/) based on [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

### How to build for firefox reviewers:
#### Prequisites
1. Have nvs (https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) installed for node (This version of ScalaJS needs node version 8 installed)
2. Have java8 installed (This version of Scala doesn't support later jvms)

run bin/deploy

build/build.zip will have the packaged file

## Statement of Inspiration

Quoted from Steve Yegge's [Excellent Blog Post](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-borderlands-2-gun-discarders-club.html) About Borderlands 2, which is another loot game
>Here's the thing, though. It's not just about capacity. If Gearbox wants to do this Right, by which I mean pull their heads out and do something that nobody in the game industry has ever done before, what they really need to do is give players a database.
>
>That's what we want, really. You make 87 bazillion guns, and let us collect them? Well then we're going to want hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of guns in our collections. Not twenty, or whatever stupidly low number you've given us. That just spawns modding and mule characters and leaving the game altogether -- any outlet from the collection pressure; players will use them all.
>
>What BL1 needed was a way for you to effectively manage a collection of a thousand guns. What if you want to look at all your Mashers? Or all your weapons by type, or by elemental damage, or by manufacturer? I'm not asking for a data warehouse here, or for some fancy text-based console-query UI. I mean, -I- would use it, but obviously we want to keep this mainstream.
>
>If you start by formulating the basic problem as: "How do I manage a collection of a thousand guns," then your UX guys should be able to come up with something acceptable. No — you know what? Fuck acceptable. They should be able to come up with something awesome, something in keeping with the innovation and forward-looking badassery that we've all come to associate with Gearbox and Borderlands.

### Newer todos:
- Card Views
  - allows seeing gems / uniques etc as items in a 2d grid of cells
    - each cell is like a card
  - beefs up the map view
    - though replace the map view with an atlas view

- Quick comparision of item to all other items in the stash
  - allows for seeing how the item stacks up to all other items
    - maybe use something like spark-line bar charts
    - will be great for ssf

#### Public [trello board](https://trello.com/b/xr7dx96M/looty) for tracking progress on tasks I am actively working on.



## Todo
### For pure love of the loot
- [ ] Collectors view for Uniques (grayed out pictures for Uniques not obtained)
- [ ] Trophy room that allows for displaying epic items. With categories (Best DPS Item, Highest Score By Slot)

### Loot Management
- [x] Odd / even row colors (fph)
- [x] Allow users to save filter sets
- [x] Load StashTab on click
- [x] Add / Remove Columns (prioritized for fph)
- [ ] Require ctrl to show tooltips (fph suggestion)
- [ ] Custom and better default item scoring options [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1q5rdi/its_worth_keeping_if/)
- [ ] Show reason for score in the item detail.
- [ ] Ability to click on a row and label the item in that row
- [ ] Column for recipes for an item (chromatics mostly)
- [ ] Recipes view
- [ ] Custom Calculated Columns
- [ ] Multi-Select Rows with Ctrl (useful for other features)
- [ ] Label items with colors (how can this persist across item moves?)
- [ ] Create an inventory view that shows item by color for help organizing / garbage collecting items
- [ ] Recipes (Chaos for set etc, not sure if GGG frowns on this or not)
- [ ] Give the players a playing mode (via the leveling screen) and let them mark certain stash tabs as auto-refresh then auto-watch those tabs and make sounds when an item is looted and identified that passes certain filters.
- [ ] Custom Filter sets (can be tied to store pages)
- [ ] Decode an item's affixes and show how it matches up to best ones available in the item detail display
- [ ] Show how good an item is compared to the best in slot for the level compared to other items the player has

### Extensibility and compatability with other sites
- [ ] Act as a secure API that can get data up to other sites and act as a Pseudo API until GGG makes one (if they do, *cough* item level *ahem* item uuids *ATAZIRIQUADSWTFCHOO* last mod time get-stash-items/{tabs:1} *hack*)
- [ ] Provide CSV / Google Document export of items table
- [ ] Upload builds / equipment to the http://poebuilds.com
- [ ] Get stats for current character's build from http://poebuilds.com and use it to calculate actual dps and so on for a character with an item and for a skill

### Trading help
- [ ] Templating to automatically create shop posts, via custom filters.
- [ ] Search for similar items on http://poe.xy.is [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1vodwm/faster_trading_with_poexyz/ceu9n5m)
- [ ] User online tracking that can be sent to third party sites, to indicate that the user is able to trade
- [ ] Integrate with instant messaging platforms / chat rooms and provide those hooks up to trading sites (web-rtc?) to allow users to trade with each other

### Improved Program Logic
- [ ] Smart detection of moved items
- [ ] User can mark an item as moved and inventory as dirty
- [ ] Handle when stash tabs are re-ordered
- [ ] Allow users to upload items whose affixes failed to parse
- [ ] Or maybe make affix parsers configurable
- [ ] Better refresh logic, remove only stash tabs might be left behind after a refresh

### User Help
- [x] Messaging Area To Help players understand what is going on as it loads
- [ ] Turn guide in this format, progress meter at top is neat [gitbookio](http://web.archive.org/web/20140404205153/http://gitbookio.github.io/javascript/README.html)
- [ ] Simplify Demo Home Page to be a lot more like http://haste-lang.org/
- [ ] Tutorial video on searches operators within the boxes
- [ ] Add feedback / suggestion options inside of the extension itself

## Development instructions

#### Useful links:

- [Firefox extension documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
- [Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/)
- [Scala 2.12 Library](https://devdocs.io/scala~2.12_library/) parsed doc from previous site Library API but easier to search
- [RePoe](https://github.com/brather1ng/RePoE) repository of Path of Exile resources. Contains the generated data from GGPK file in JSON format  
- [Itellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Java IDE with native Scala support

### How to build for iterative development
#### Prequisites

1. Have nvs (https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) installed for node (This version of ScalaJS needs node version 8 installed)
2. Have java8 installed (https://github.com/frekele/oracle-java/releases) (This version of Scala doesn't support later jvms)
3. Have SBT (Simple Build Tool) for compiling Scala into js. This is already __included__ in looty project (sbt-launch-0.13.0.jar).
And is run via sbt or sbt-win.cmd commands.

in the project root at command line:  
#### Linux:

    bin/sbt
#### Windows:

	bin\sbt-win.cmd
    
Build a development version with:  

    fastOptJS
    
To generate .js on the fly, while you save any changes in code use:

	~fastOptJS


A javascript fill will be built at:  

    looty/target/web/public/main/looty-fastopt.js

This folder has the manifest and can be used with firefox for debugging:  

    looty/target/web/public/main/

Load it in firefox with `about:debugging` use looty-dev.html

### How to build for firefox reviewers and release:

Note: Firefox Add-on's come in form of .ixr files. Which are simply zip files with different extension. 

Bump version number in:
    
    ./looty/src/main/public/manifest.json
    ./looty/src/main/scala/looty/views/HomeView.scala
    
 ### Linux:
 
    bin/deploy

`/build/build.zip` will have the packaged file  
`/build/buildffsrc.zip` will have firefox release package file

#### Windows:

    bin\sbt-win.cmd
    
in sbt, optional 

    clean
and    
    
    compile
    fullOptJS    

Because windows does not come with default zip command line tool, which could automate this part, we have to zip files ourselves. :crying_cat_face:  
Zip following files and directories into choose-some-name.zip 
(for installation in ff change extension to irx)
    
    jslib/
    images/
    less/
    looty.html
    popup.html
    looty-opt.js
    manifest.json
